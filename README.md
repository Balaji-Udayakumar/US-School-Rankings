# US-School-Rankings
A database management project that empowers UMD Smith School stakeholders with comprehensive, accurate, and easily accessible program ranking data.

# Project Overview
Our aim is to design, develop and implement an efficient and centralized database management system that will provide comprehensive data on  comparable graduate student programs from diverse sources across the USA, with a particular emphasis on the graduate programs offered by Robert H. Smith School of Business.

# Whom would it benefit ?
1. Prospective Students and Parents: Prospective students considering higher education will benefit from a comprehensive and objective ranking system. This will help them in making informed decisions about where to apply based on a more accurate representation of each university and their courseâ€™s performance.


2. Current Students: Those students who are currently enrolled in universities can gain insights into the quality and performance of their institutions,  and find out more from the value that they are receiving from their institute. 


3. Smith School Administration: Our Smith School is also a stakeholder as this project may help the university and this Department in particular if they warrant any change to their courses methodologies or features. Our team wants to help the authorities understand where they stand and what measures can be focussed on to improve the rankings and prestige of our university even further.  This analysis can help them identify areas of improvement and market their strengths.

# Data Sources Utilized:
We have sourced our data from a variety of well-respected and renowned university ranking websites. These platforms are recognized for their detailed and current assessments of academic institutions worldwide. Our chosen sources, along with their reference links, are as follows:

Data Source Reference Links:

- Times Higher Education Ranking - https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/

- QS ranking - https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings/

- Academic Ranking of World Universities - https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/arwu/

- US News & World Report Rankings - https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities

# Project Analysis and Application:
By integrating data from these diverse sources, our database system assembles a rich and detailed picture of the current academic landscape. This multifaceted analysis aids in identifying trends, strengths, and areas of improvement for universities, and it provides valuable insights for students, educators, and policy makers in making informed decisions.

# Conclusion:
This project serves as a comprehensive tool for prospective students, current students, Smith School of Business, and also other universities, enabling our stakeholders to evaluate university and course rankings effectively. By aggregating insights from several ranking sources into a single platform, it provides a holistic view of university performance. We have retrieved several datasets that were used to answer our business transactions.  


However, to enhance the effectiveness of this model, it is recommended to incorporate more data on universities. More data points such as student-to-faculty ratios, internship opportunities, and global collaborations could be used. This will ultimately foster a more holistic understanding of the courses of interest.
